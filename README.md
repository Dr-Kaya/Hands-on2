# Boston House Price Classification and Regression Models

## Project Overview
This project implements both classification and regression models using the Boston House price dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adritpal08/boston-house-price-prediction). The goal is to explore and predict house prices using various machine learning techniques.

## Models Developed

### Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Regression Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Ridge, Lasso Regression and Elastic Regressions

All models were evaluated using appropriate metrics:
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared

## Why Use Google Colab?
This project is implemented in Google Colab, offering several advantages for data science and machine learning projects:

### Key Benefits
- **Free GPU/TPU Access**: Accelerate model training with complimentary GPU and TPU resources
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Write and execute code in an interactive environment, perfect for experimentation
- **Zero Setup**: No local installation or environment management needed - just open and code!

## Getting Started
You can explore the entire project and run the code interactively using Google Colab for a smooth and hassle-free experience.
